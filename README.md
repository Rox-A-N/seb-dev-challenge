# SEB: Dev Code Challenge

-This will be a website that integrates with the GitHub API
-Using the GitHub API I will allow a user to choose a language from gitHub
-On select of a language, the top 5 starred repos in that language will populate the DOM 

## To Begin:

-npm install -g create-react-app
This allows for the creation of a react app with file tree created for the user (me)

-type: create-react-app seb-dev-challenge
This will set up the new React app

-cd into new directory seb-dev-challenge

-npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
We can now preview the app live
