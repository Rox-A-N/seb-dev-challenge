# SEB: Dev Code Challenge

-This will be a website that integrates with the GitHub API
-Using the GitHub API I will allow a user to choose a language from gitHub
-On select of a language, the top 5 starred repos in that language will populate the DOM 

## To Begin:

-npm install -g create-react-app
This allows for the creation of a react app with file tree created for the user (me)

-type: create-react-app seb-dev-challenge
This will set up the new React app

-cd into new directory seb-dev-challenge

-npm start
This spins up the new app to localhost:3000 in the browser
We can now preview the app live

## Registered app with GitHub for OAuth

In GitHub user Settings, select "Developer Settings" > "OAuth Apps" > "New OAuth App"
to register newly created app

## Install Axios to interact with GitHub API
-npm install Axios
-import Axios into App.js
